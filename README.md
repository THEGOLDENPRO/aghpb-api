  <sub>Behold the **anime girls holding programming books** API!</sub>

</div>

This is an API I made for the anime girls holding programming books [github repo](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) because I was bored. It scraps a local copy of the repo and thanks to that I was able to implement a ``Book-Date-Added`` header.

It's a rewrite of the [old API](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb_api) but written in Python using the [Fast API](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) library instead.

> ### You can catch the api at https://api.devgoldy.xyz/aghpb/v1

If you are cloning this repo to run it for yourself you'll probably want to pull the submodule too.
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
