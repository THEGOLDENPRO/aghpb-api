  # ðŸ“š AGHPB API

  <sub>Behold the **anime girls holding programming books** API!</sub>

  [![Docker Badge](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/devgoldy/aghpb_api?label=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/devgoldy/aghpb_api "We're on docker!")

This is an API I made for the anime girls holding programming books [github repo](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) because I was bored.
It's a rewrite of the [old API](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb_api_legacy) but written in Python using the [Fast API](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) library instead.
It scraps a local copy of the repo and thanks to that I was able to implement headers like ``Book-Date-Added`` (returns the date and time a book was added).

If you are cloning this repo to run it for yourself you'll probably want to pull the submodule too.
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## ðŸ’« API Wrappers
I was also even more bored so I decided to write an API wrapper in every mfing language I can possible, including those I've never really written in.

These are the languages I've written so far:
- **ðŸ¦€ Rust - [``aghpb.rs``](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb.rs)**
- **ðŸŸ¦ TypeScript - [``aghpb.ts``](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb.ts)**
- **âš« C - [``aghpb.c``](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb.c)** (not async, ~~might blow up~~)
- **ðŸ”¥ Mojo - ``Soonâ„¢``**
- **ðŸ”µ Go - ``Soonâ„¢``**
- **ðŸŒ• Lua - [``aghpb.lua``](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb.lua)** (not async)
- ~~**â˜• Java** - ``Soonâ„¢``~~ *"fuck you java (maven included)"*
